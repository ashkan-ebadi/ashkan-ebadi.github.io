Ashkan Ebadi is a multidisciplinary applied data scientist with expertise in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, deep learning, and graph analytics. He received his Ph.D. in information systems engineering with an emphasis on AI-based decision support systems. He also carried a two-year postdoctoral fellowship in health informatics at the University of Florida (USA). He is currently a senior research officer at the National Research Council Canada (NRC), the government of Canada’s largest research organization, an Affiliate Assistant Professor at Concordia University (Canada), and a Senior Member of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) organization.

Ashkan has intensive academic and industrial experience in the design and implementation of data-driven solutions. His 12+ years of professional industry experience covers the entire life-cycle of the data science pipeline, from (business) problem definition to scalable big data analytics applications. His research aims to leverage advanced analytics and machine learning to solve complex real-life problems in various domains.
